## Agenda Proposal / Discussion Items

Agenda Item | Who | Description
---- | ---- | ----
Last meeting recap |  &nbsp; |&nbsp; 
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; | 1. Scope definition: <br/> a. User stories template doc (Telefónica) <br/> b. API documentation template doc <br/> c. API readiness minimum criteria doc <br/> d. API design guideline: API spec format <br/> e. Testing principles doc: recommended test tools <br/> f. Proposal for Standard resource description (MS) <br/> g. Generic principles doc: user feedback  <br/> h. Authentication and authorization doc (DT) <br/> i. Proposal for API documentation template <br/>
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; | 2. Presentation uploaded by Telefónica to address scope & additional points: https://github.com/telekom/telco-global-api-alliance/blob/main/WorkingGroups/Commonalities/Guidelines-API-Alliance-TEFinput.pdf
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; | 3. Questions for telemetry & technology related tools parked until project scope decision taken by the steering committee (GitHub issue #12)
|  &nbsp; |  &nbsp; | 4. GitHub issue #12 closed: service APIs are in scope, transformation functions are in scope for a reference/example implementation (but not a standard)
Contributions|  &nbsp; |&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; | Telefonica	| Template for Userstory <br/> * waiting for feedback from Intel and MS on the initial presentation <br/> Preparing draft on potential exposure gateway of Camara services API <br/> * transformation functions (mapping data schemas into model): keep an updated table for mapping <br/> * no solution for exposure gateway has been proposed until now: TEF proposal is to use the CAPIF common framework; a single unified framework not tied to 3GPP (to be discussed with Markus);<br/> https://www.3gpp.org/common-api-framework-capif
&nbsp; | DT	|  Authentication & Authorization <br/> * the initial proposal is to implement OIDC (OpenID Connect with OAuth2):  https://openid.net/connect/ <br/> * DT has already implemented this auth. framework for an internal project.
Open points from QoD working group | &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; | 1. Should tools for telemetry/scheduling/performance characterizations be based on a technology like Kubernetes? <br/> *Kubernetes seems to be the preferred platform but we park the question to discuss it with a larger quorum*
&nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2. Use of Intel's Smart Edge Open (OpenNESS) platform?  <br/> *The platform seems to require licenses; we would like to hear Intel's suggestions*
 &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 3. Since implementation is part of project scope, would it make sense to have a common platform/portal to publish/discover and test and validate the APIs? <br/> _Telefónica suggested offering such a platform instance for the dedicated use of this project, but since the steering committee decided that implementation of transformation functions is up to each participant (GitHub issue#12), we will double check on Monday (29 Nov) with the PM whether use an own platform or let the CNCF to provide & manage the platform._
Q&A / AOB	| &nbsp; | 
&nbsp; | &nbsp; | 1. Invite new Telefonica WG members to GitHub private repository <br/> 2. QoD work group: proposal to cancel the Friday 26 Nov meeting due to Thanksgiving and probable lack of quorum
