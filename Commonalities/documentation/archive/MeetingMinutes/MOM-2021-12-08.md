Agenda Item | |  Description
---- | ---- | ----
**Contributions** | 
&nbsp; | Template for User story and Exposure Gateway | Template for Userstory <br/>-   waiting for feedback from Intel and MS on the initial presentation <br/>     -   transformation functions (mapping data schemas into model): keep an updated table for mapping <br/>  -   no solution for exposure gateway has been proposed until now: TEF proposal is to use the  **CAPIF**  common framework; a single unified framework not tied to 3GPP: [https://www.3gpp.org/common-api-framework-capif](https://www.3gpp.org/common-api-framework-capif) <br/>  -   presentation from Jose on user story and exposure gateway: https://github.com/camaraproject/rep_main/blob/main/WorkingGroups/Commonalities/Commonalities-TID-20211208.pdf <br/> - CAPIF does not deal with API semantics → can be used both for 3gpp and non-3gpp; unified exposure layer <br/>    -   There are some TEF colleagues working on a EC funded R&I project called EVOLVED-5G (https://evolved-5g.eu/). One of the outcomes of this project is to have a CAPIF implementation. The first sw version is to be released by Q12022 (that’s what we’ve been told, though some delay due to COVID ramping up might be possible). TEF work in the project is mainly focused on coordination activities - the development and implementation work of CAPIF will be led by other project partners (developers/integrators/academia). However, from TEF side, what we can do is to fetch CAPIF sw version released by the project and make it available for use in CAMARA.  <br/>
&nbsp;|Authentication & Authorization | -   the initial proposal is to implement OIDC (OpenID Connect with OAuth2): [https://openid.net/connect/](https://openid.net/connect/)
